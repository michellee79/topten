<p>14 days ago, {FIRSTNAME} {LASTNAME} left a less than 3 Star Review. &nbsp;It is our hope that {BUSINESSNAME} was able to satisfactorily resolve the concerns.&nbsp;</p>
<p>{FIRSTNAME} {LASTNAME}&nbsp;has three options available.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Do nothing and the original review will be deleted.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Click {LINK1}&nbsp;and leave a new review that is 3 Stars or better if you feel that {BUSINESSNAME} made an honest attempt of addressing your concerns.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Click {LINK2}&nbsp;and leave a new review with the same number of stars you gave them originally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(TTP LINK WOULD GO HERE AND WHEN THEY CLICK IT, IT AUTOMATICALLY TAKES THEM TO PAGE FOR THAT BUSINESS WHERE THEY CAN LEAVE A REVIEW THAT WILL POST LIVE REGARDLESS IF THE REVIEW IS LESS THAN 3 STARS)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>",

"<p>{FIRSTNAME} {LASTNAME}&nbsp;who previously left a less than 3 Star Review for {BUSINESSNAME} 14 days ago, has posted a final review that is now live on the site. &nbsp;We cannot delete or modify this review this review in any way as the Business Member was given the opportunity to resolve the concern(s.)</p>
